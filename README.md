# Sandbox IDE

Sandbox is a collaborative Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed to fit on top of current infrastructure already owned by a company or individual. In the event that such infrastructure does not exist, Sandbox IDE provides GitHub integration. Sandbox IDE is basically an interactive, collaborative IDE hosted totally on the web. In short, it is the Google Drive for code.

There are two major components to Sandbox:
* Sandbox Front End
* Sandbox Back End
